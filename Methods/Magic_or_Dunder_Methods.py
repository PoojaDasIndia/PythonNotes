__new__() method

Languages such as Java and C# use the new operator to create a new instance of a class. 

In Python the __new__() magic method is implicitly called before the __init__() method.
The __new__() method returns a new object, which is then initialized by __init__().

"""
# Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores.
#  They are also called dunder methods.
