"""
To understand this pillar better, let’s use the example of a car. 
People do not see a car as thousands of individual parts.
 Instead, they see it as a well-defined object with unique behavior. 
 They do not need to understand the complexity of those parts and how they collaborate.

In simple terms, abstraction hides the internal implementations of a process or method from the user.
 In this way, the user knows what they do but not how it is done.

Abstraction is a bit different from the other pillars. Python does not grant abstract classes by default.
 Instead, Python comes with a module that fits the base for Abstract Base classes (ABC).
 A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.
